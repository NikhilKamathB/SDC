# üèÉ How do I use this project

The codebase is designed such that all commands needed for the execution of the client resides in `main.py` - aka the driver module. We establish the Carla client as a CLI application using which they can perform tasks such as data annotaion, automation, state estimation, OEDR, motion planning, basically any ascpect of the self-driving car.

## Generating actor configurations

Refer [this document](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core\_actors/) to know the differnet types of actors provided by Carla.

* Make sure you have a base configuration for any actor defined in the designated directory. In our case, you can find `vehicle0.yaml`and `pedestrian0.yaml` in `./data/config/vehicles/` and `./data/config/pedestrians/` respectively - Experiment 0 üòù.
* To get to know our configuration CLI command, run:

```
python -m main generate_configuration --help 
```

* To generate configurations for vehicles, you have to run (defaults to vehicle):

```
python -m main generate_vehicle_configuration
```

* To generate configurations for pedestrians, run:

```
python -m main generate_configuration --config-dir=<CONFIG_DIR> \
                                      --reference-config-file=<REFERENCE_YAML_FILE> \
                                      --for-pedestrian --no-for-vehicle 
```

## Generating synthetic data in Carla

Refer [this document](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core\_sensors/) to know the differnet types of sensors provided by Carla.

* To get to know our data acquisition CLI command, run the below mentioned code. You may use the relevant setting / default setting to run this CLI.

```
python -m main generate_synthetic_data --help    # To get information about this CLI

python -m main generate_synthetic_data [OPTIONS]    # To run the code
```

## Performing Motion Planning in Carla

The following are the references used to perform motion planning for an ego vehicle in the Carla simulator - [Algorithms](https://github.com/NikhilKamathB/Algorithms/blob/main/README.md).

* Before performing the motion planning make sure to build the "Algorithms" library as described in the above referenced doc. You may also refer to the [Prerequisites and Setup](prerequisites-and-setup.md) section to build the necessary modules.
* Motion planning CLI purpose is two fold - High Level Motion Planning and Low Level Motion Planning.
* To get to know more about the High Level Motion Planning, run the below mentioned code. You may use the relevant setting / default setting to run this CLI.

```
python -m main generate_route --help.   # To get information about this CLI

python -m main generate_route [OPTIONS]    # To run the code
```
