# ðŸ“” Notes

* As much as possible, try to stick to this template. Any improvement/suggestion to this organization is always welcome.
* Let us try to write a clean code. Comment where ever necessary so that others can understand and pickup easily. Jupyter notebooks must contain minimal code. What it means is, if you have a big function, the implementation falls into the appropriate src folder and this funciton gets called in the notebook. This stands for classes as well.
* If there is anything that you feel is important, please mention them under the appropriate Tasks subheadings.
* Any tasks that you take, see to it that you are not in the main/master branch. Checkout the main/master branch and start from there. Once done, create a pull request.
* To maintain consistency, the naming of all branches except main/master must be done as follows: `<property>/<branch-name>`. The property represents, the type of commit - it may be addition of features, bug fixes, etc. For example, if you are adding a new camera model to the player, the branch name would be `[feature]/addition-of-camera-module`.
